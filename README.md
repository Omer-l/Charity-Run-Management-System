# Charity-Run-Management-System

- Developed a console system for managing charity runs using Java and many OOP techniques.
- Incorporated multiple data structures to optimize the management of data (i.e., to prevent duplications of runners at events)

<u><b>Utilised:</b></u> Java, OOP


  ### Object Oriented Programming Coursework, Second Year of Computer Science

  ## Use cases
- **List Event Information**
-  **List Venue Details**
- **Search Competitor’s Event Entries**


Task is to design a Java 8 program for the charity running event management system described above, which provides a console-based (text I/O) user interface that facilitates the three listed use cases.

  Below is a partial UML class of the project, for which, the project includes Java classes.

1. Program presents the User with a console-based menu to interact with the data set. Application consists of some ‘dummy’ data pre-coded into the application. There is no requirement to insert or update any data. There is also error-handling for incorrect data.

2. The User can simply exit the program by entering zero. The three other menu options allow the User to inspect the information in the data set (note again that this program is entirely read-only and there was no requirement to add, update or delete any part of the data set).

  Below are images of the necessary interactions of the program with respect to the options mentioned above.
